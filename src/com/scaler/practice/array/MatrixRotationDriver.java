 * Problem Description
 *
 * You are given a n x n 2D matrix A representing an image.
 *
 * Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).
 *
 * You need to do this in place.
 *
 * Note: If you end up using an additional array, you will only receive partial score.
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 1000
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 *
 * First argument is a 2D matrix A of integers
 *
 *
 * Output Format
 *
 * Return the 2D rotated matrix.
 *
 *
 * Example Input
 *
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  [
 *     [1, 2],
 *     [3, 4]
 *  ]
 *
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  [
 *     [1]
 *  ]
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 *
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  [
 *     [3, 1],
 *     [4, 2]
 *  ]
 *
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  [
 *     [1]
 *  ]
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 *
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  After rotating the matrix by 90 degree:
 *  1 goes to 2, 2 goes to 4
 *  4 goes to 3, 3 goes to 1
 *
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  2D array remains the ssame as there is only element.
